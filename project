I created a website for predicting car prices as part of my design thinking project. My goal was to predict the price of used cars. 
I trained the model using random forest regression and fine-tuned its performance using randomized search cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization. 
To ensure robust validation, I used K-fold cross-validation. Finally, I developed a website using HTML and CSS and integrated my model into it.
